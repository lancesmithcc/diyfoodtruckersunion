      content: `Before you can legally operate your food truck, you need to establish your business as a legal entity. This foundational step protects your personal assets and provides credibility with suppliers, customers, and financial institutions.

**Why Business Structure Matters:**
Most successful food truck operators choose an LLC (Limited Liability Company) or incorporate federally because it offers personal asset protection while maintaining operational flexibility. Unlike corporations, LLCs have fewer reporting requirements and allow profits to pass through to your personal tax return.

**The Registration Process:**
Start by choosing and reserving your business name through your provincial corporate registry. Ensure the name isn't already taken and consider securing matching domain names for future marketing. Next, file your Articles of Incorporation or Organization and create an Operating Agreement that outlines ownership structure and operational procedures.

**Federal Requirements:**
Obtain a Business Number (BN) from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), even if you don't plan to hire employees immediately. This number is required for business banking, tax filings, and many permit applications. The process is free when done directly through the CRA website.`,
      proTip: "Register your business in your home province unless you plan to operate exclusively in another province. Federal incorporation is typically unnecessary for small food truck operations and adds complexity.",

      content: `Health department approval is absolutely critical for food truck operations. These permits ensure you meet food safety standards and protect both your customers and your business from health-related liabilities.

**Mobile Food Vendor License:**
This is your primary operating permit that allows you to prepare and serve food from a mobile unit. The application process typically includes submitting detailed plans of your truck's layout, equipment specifications, and food handling procedures. Inspectors will review your water systems, refrigeration, cooking equipment, and waste disposal methods.

**Commissary Kitchen Requirements:**
Most jurisdictions require food trucks to operate from an approved commissary kitchen for food preparation, cleaning, and storage. This isn't just a legal requirement—it's a practical necessity for maintaining food safety standards and having adequate prep space.

**Food Handler Certifications:**
All staff members who handle food must obtain food handler permits or certifications. These typically involve completing a food safety course and passing an exam. Certifications must be renewed regularly, usually annually.

**Inspection Process:**
Expect multiple inspections: initial plan review, pre-operational inspection of your truck, and ongoing periodic inspections. Inspectors will check temperature logs, cleaning procedures, equipment maintenance, and staff certification compliance.`,

      content: `Beyond health permits, you'll need various business licenses and permits to operate legally in your jurisdiction. These requirements vary significantly by city and province, making local research essential.

**General Business License:**
Most cities require a general business license for any commercial operation within their boundaries. This basic permit establishes your right to conduct business and is often a prerequisite for other specialized permits.

**Vendor/Peddler Permits:**
Many jurisdictions require special vendor permits for mobile businesses. These permits may restrict where and when you can operate, so understanding the limitations is crucial for route planning and revenue projections.

**GST/HST Registration:**
You'll need to register for GST/HST collection if your annual revenue exceeds $30,000. This registration also allows you to claim input tax credits on business purchases, which can provide significant savings.

**Fire Department Permits:**
If your truck uses propane or other flammable materials, you may need fire department approval. This often includes inspections of your fire suppression systems and safety equipment.

**Signage Permits:**
Some cities regulate mobile business signage and may require permits for exterior displays, especially if you plan to use electronic signs or exceed certain size limitations.`,

**General Liability Insurance:**
This foundational coverage protects against customer injuries, property damage, and food-related illnesses. Most venues and events require proof of general liability insurance with minimum coverage of $1-2 million per occurrence.

**Commercial Auto Insurance:**
Your food truck requires commercial vehicle insurance, not personal auto coverage. This specialized insurance covers the vehicle, equipment, and liability while driving. Standard auto policies exclude commercial use and won't cover claims.

**Product Liability Insurance:**
Specific coverage for food-related claims is crucial. This insurance protects against lawsuits related to foodborne illness, allergic reactions, or contamination. Given the potential severity of food-related claims, this coverage is essential.

**Property Insurance:**
Protect your equipment, inventory, and truck modifications with comprehensive property coverage. This includes protection against theft, vandalism, fire, and weather damage. Consider agreed-value coverage for custom equipment.

**Workers' Compensation:**
Required in most provinces once you hire employees, workers' compensation covers medical expenses and lost wages for work-related injuries. Even if not legally required, it provides valuable protection for your team.`,

**Zoning Compliance:**
Most cities have specific zones where mobile food vendors can operate. These regulations often restrict operations near brick-and-mortar restaurants, schools, or residential areas. Research zoning maps and understand time restrictions that may apply.

**Public Space Permits:**
Operating on public property typically requires special permits and may involve lottery systems or first-come-first-served applications. Popular locations often have limited permits available, making early application essential.

**Private Property Agreements:**
Many successful food trucks operate primarily on private property with landowner permission. While this may not require city permits, you'll need written agreements that clearly outline terms, insurance requirements, and revenue sharing if applicable.

**Event Permits:**
Festivals, farmers markets, and special events often require separate vendor permits. These applications typically include insurance requirements, health permit verification, and sometimes competitive selection processes.

**Parking Regulations:**
Understanding local parking laws is crucial. Some cities prohibit commercial vehicles from parking on residential streets overnight, while others have specific regulations about mobile food preparation and service.`,

**Renewal Calendar Management:**
Create a comprehensive calendar tracking all permit expiration dates, renewal requirements, and application deadlines. Most permits require renewal annually, but some may have different cycles. Missing renewal deadlines can result in gaps in legal operation authority.

**Ongoing Inspection Requirements:**
Health departments typically conduct periodic inspections, and you may be subject to random compliance checks. Maintain detailed records of cleaning schedules, temperature logs, and staff training to demonstrate ongoing compliance.

**Record Keeping Systems:**
Implement organized systems for maintaining all legal documents, permits, insurance certificates, and compliance records. Digital copies stored in cloud systems provide backup protection and easy access during inspections or emergencies.

**Regulatory Updates:**
Food service regulations evolve regularly. Stay informed about changes in health codes, zoning laws, and business regulations that might affect your operation. Join local food truck associations or business groups for regulatory updates.

**Compliance Costs:**
Budget for ongoing compliance costs including permit renewals, inspection fees, insurance premiums, and potential legal consultation. These recurring expenses are essential operational costs that should be factored into your pricing strategy.`,
