**New vs Used Considerations:**
- **New trucks** ($80,000-$200,000+): Come with warranties, latest equipment, but higher depreciation
- **Used trucks** ($15,000-$80,000): Lower initial cost, but may require repairs and updates
- **Conversion trailers** ($10,000-$50,000): Most budget-friendly option, requires separate vehicle

**Size and Layout Impact:**
- **Compact trucks** (14-16 feet): Lower cost, easier parking, limited menu capacity
- **Standard trucks** (18-24 feet): Balanced cost and functionality, most popular choice
- **Large trucks** (26+ feet): Higher capacity and revenue potential, but increased costs

**Hidden Costs to Consider:**
- Customization and kitchen installation: $10,000-$40,000
- Permits and inspections during build: $500-$2,000
- Transportation and delivery fees: $500-$3,000
- Initial repairs and maintenance: $1,000-$5,000`,
